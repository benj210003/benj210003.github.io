          <h2 class="abt-me-txt">About Me:</h2>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">I'm Ben Jupina! I am a junior computer science major at the University of Pittsburgh.I am currently looking for summer 2024 internships.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">I am from Reading Pennsylvania, which is the pretzel capital of the world. I think that that is a really big deal.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">This website is just a quick way for me to practice HTML and CSS. It was made from scratch without using a framework. It looks kind of bad but that is probably because I just learned how to use HTML and CSS, but it was a fun process at least!</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Hopefully this will give you nostalgia and remind you of your MySpace profile from like 2005, but it took me about 4 ish hours to make this (2 of which I was learning HTML and CSS), so I hope you have fun looking at it and learning more about me :)</p>

            <h3 class="abt-me-txt">Outdoors</h3>
            <p class="abt-me-txt">The outdoors is one of the most important things to me. There is nothing better than going outside and getting some fresh air. From hiking, biking, to climbing, I have never enjoyed anything more than feeling the sun on my face and being outside.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="abt-me-txt">Climbing</h3>
            <p class="abt-me-txt">Strongly related to my interest in the outdoors is my interest in climbing. I enjoy both climbing indoors and outdoors; inside climbing is good exercise, but outside climbing is just running around in the woods, which is a lot of fun!</p>

          <p class="abt-me-txt">I worked within the process planning department. The process planning department is responsible for creating manufacturing line-ups from orders, that are then followed in the factory.</p>

          <p class="abt-me-txt">This really pushed me out of my comfort zone. I was a server at this restaurant, which is something that really made me hone my people skills. I think that this experience was invaluable, since it really made me more outgoing.</p>

          <h2 class="abt-me-txt">Programming:</h2>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Since I am a computer science major, I have lots of experience with programming. My mother tongue is Java, and this is the main language that I use for school. Other languages that I am familiar with include C, Python, and Javascript (which I guess isn't really a programming language...but close enough).</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Programming is one of the most important skills that I have learned through school and on my own. From taking courses in data structures to learning how to build a website like this one, programming has allowed me to accomplish many things.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Though I began learning to programming later than some people who are similar to me, I feel like I have caught up by learning on my own. I use many online resources as well as books to try to catch up with my peers who have been programming for longer than I have.</p>

          <p class="abt-me-txt">ThoughtSpot is a software that was recently introduced to Carpenter Technology before my internship began. The recent introduction as well as the limited documentation for proper usage made it a challenge to learn how to use, but by the end of my internship, I had self taught myself to proficiency.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Being able to use SQL and ThoughtSpot allowed me to automate several data analysis processes that my colleagues would do by hand at Carpenter, which overall increased the efficiency of my team.</p>

          <h2 class="abt-me-txt">Science, Engineering, and Math:</h2>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Before I began studying computer science, I studied civil engineering. I believe that this gives me a unique outlook on many problems, as well as a skill set that only few other people my age have.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Engineering methods that I learned within my civil engineering curriculum are very useful to solve a wide variety of problems. Engineering has taught me that problems can be broken down into many smaller problems that come together as a whole end product.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">As well as learning engineering principles, I also have a very strong math and science background that allows me to tackle any problem. I have taken my fair share of chemistry, physics, and upper level math courses that give me a large variety of tools for problem solving.</p>

          <p class="abt-me-txt">I believe that soft skills are the most impportant trait that someone can have. Someone can be a technical genius, but if they are lacking in soft skills, the technical skills they have are now useless.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Throughout my schooling and work experience, I have honed my soft skills, such as interpersonal communication and presentations. I am very good at collaborating with others to get the job done.</p>
          <p class="abt-me-txt">Especially while working in the restaurant, I learned that being able to connect with a customer is the single most important skill that one can have, no matter the industry that you are in. Having to wait tables made me realize this, while also making me very comfortable doing so.</p>
